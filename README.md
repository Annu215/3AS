Detailed description:

                  Online Pizza delivery system, initially asks the user to input their name. Then the total distance from the pizza shop 
has to be given in kilometers. If Pizza has to be ordered within the shop then distance is 0 kilometer. It checks for delivery charges
and gives the delivery fee. After that it asks the diameter of the pizza in Inches, the scale is given as 10,12,14 and 16 inches,User should
select one.

                 Later, The user should select the type of pizzacrust as per his/her choice among Hand-Tossed(H), Thin-crust(T) and 
Deep-dish(D). Along with Cheese, Additional Toppings are given as Pepperoni and Sausage, which charges extra amount. User should enter Y/y
for 'YES' and N/n for 'NO'.

                 Finally, The System gives the total amount that the user is payable. The total amount will be the sum of pizza cost,
delivery fee, additional toppings and other taxes including GST.

-->We have made use of Try Catch-Exception handling statement.

Thus, We have written Unit test cases for the same code. Also Javadoc is generated in both the main code and test cases and 
HTML links files are uploaded.
